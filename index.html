									<h3>Digitalise Standards</h3>
									<p>Utilising the framework of a working Government Standard website, I transitioned the current standards required for Defence publications from PDFs to basic websites. This was to provide and electronic resource that was easier to navigate. They were not made to be commercialised.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-info-circle"></span>
									<h3>Standards Quick Reference</h3>
									<p>To help users find information in a static PDF quicker, an infographic was developed for each standard to provide quick reference to the location of relevant chapter or section. If there was an overall grouping of topics provided then that was used as the framework for the relevant content and to align with the publication.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-graduation-cap"></span>
									<h3>Introductory Learning Material</h3>
									<p>Developed introductory learning packages for various elements of Defence standards and specifications. With the move towards utilising a more visual warning nomenclature the more recent Australian Defence standards have aligned more with the globally harmonized system of safety icons.Graphics and singal words have been developed to convey a clearer understanding of the hazard posed.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Blog Articles</h3>
									<p>Developed a series of blog articles for my current company that provided research and information on topics within technical documentation, but also provided an look at existing subjects and explained them in the context of how they affected business.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-pen"></span>
									<h3>Techincal Writing Career Assistance Guide</h3>
									<p>After experiencing many years of not really being able to find a guide that explains what is needed to be a technical writer/author. There was a time in the past when this role was well staffed and tertiary coursed. However with changing technology and expectations of other roles to do more documentation, techincal writers have been relagated to the eidtorial clean up aspects of document development. I am hoping this guide will promote a better understanding of what technical writers can actually do, and how they are crucial to the transition from paper based manuals to interactive digital publications</p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-book-open"></span>
									<h3>Legacy Defence Publications</h3>
									<p>This is an example of a simple PDF publication being hosted on a server. The publication can be flipped like a book and have simple navigation options externally to preliminary pages, table of contents, sections/chapters and the list of abbreviations. The intention was to provide some functionality to existing legacy publications that would not be worth the cost of transitioning to an S1000D IETP or similar. The additional artwork cover was to provide a sense of ownership for the particular service and contact information that would be useful.<br><ul class="actions">
